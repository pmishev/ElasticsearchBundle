# Multilanguage support

The Elasticsearch bundle provides support for multilanguage fields in your Elasticsearch types. The basic idea is that if you want to have a field `title` that can be translated in more than one language, separate fields would be used for each language, such as `title-en`, `title-fr`, etc. Also a `title-default` field would be created for your default language.

Setting up and using multilanguage fields is partially covered in the other chapters of the docs, but here we'll try cover it all.

## Setup

* First thing to do is define a service implementing `LanguageProviderInterface` and tagged as `sfes.language_provider`. 

```
services:
    app.es.language_provider:
        class: AppBundle\ElasticSearch\LanguageProvider
        arguments:
            - %elasticsearch_languages%
        tags:
            - { name: sfes.language_provider }
```

That service must have a method returning an array of language codes that will be supported in the application:

```
    /**
     * Returns array of available language codes
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function getLanguages();
```

* Next, you need to declare your multilanguage field as such in your annotation:

```
    /**
     * @ES\Property(
     *  name="title",
     *  type="string",
     *  multilanguage=true,
     *  options={
     *      "analyzer":"{lang}_analyzer",
     *  }
     * )
     */
    public $title;
```
> Note the use of **{lang}** in the analyzer declaration. It is going to be replaced by a respective language code at runtime.

* Then, you must make sure you have all language-specific analyzers defined in your index config:
```
    indices:
        products:
            settings:
                analysis:
                    analyzer:
                        default_analyzer:
                            ...
                        fr_analyzer:
                            ...
```
> You must have **default** language analyzer set, even if you don't use it, as it will be used as a fallback, in case the required language-specific analyzer is not set.

## Usage

Multilanguage fields are instances of `MLProperty`. Creating a document would look like this:
```php
$im = $this->get('sfes.index.product');

$product = new Product();
$product->id = 5;
$product->title = new MLProperty();
$product->title->set('Acme title', 'en');
$product->title->set('Default title', 'default'); // (optional) only if you need a default language field in your app 

$im->persist($product);
$im->getConnection()->commit();
```

When retrieving results, you can get a specific language value like this:
```php
$repo = $this->get('sfes.index.product')->getRepository('AppBundle:Product');
$product = $repo->getById(5);
$title = $product->title->get('en');
```
